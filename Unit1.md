# Internet Protocols, HTML 5.0  
**Periods: 12**  

## 1. The Internet  
The Internet is a global network that connects millions of computers worldwide. It allows communication, data exchange, and access to various online resources.

## 2. Basic Internet Protocols  
Protocols are rules that define how data is transmitted over the internet. Some key protocols are:

- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** Used for accessing websites and transferring web pages.  
- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):** Used for sending emails.  
- **POP3 (Post Office Protocol 3):** Used for retrieving emails from a mail server.  
- **MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions):** Helps email messages support multimedia (images, audio, and video).  
- **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol):** Allows users to access and manage emails on a mail server without downloading them.

## 3. Domain Name Server (DNS)  
The DNS converts human-readable website names (e.g., www.google.com) into IP addresses (e.g., 142.250.180.14) so computers can locate and communicate with each other.

## 4. World Wide Web (WWW)  
The WWW is a system of interlinked web pages and resources accessible through the internet. It is based on technologies such as HTML, HTTP, and web browsers.

## 5. HTTP Request and Response Messages  
- **HTTP Request Message:** Sent by a client (browser) to request data from a web server. It includes methods like `GET` (retrieve data) and `POST` (send data).  
- **HTTP Response Message:** Sent by a web server in response to a request, containing the requested data or an error message.

## 6. Web Clients and Web Servers  
- **Web Clients:** Applications (such as browsers like Chrome, Firefox) that send HTTP requests to web servers.  
- **Web Servers:** Computers that store websites and handle client requests to serve web pages.

## 7. Web Browser  
A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) is software that allows users to access and view websites.  
It processes **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to display web content.  

### **Functions of a Web Browser:**  
- **Rendering Web Pages:** Converts HTML and CSS into a visually displayed page.  
- **Executing JavaScript:** Runs scripts to add interactivity and dynamic content.  
- **Handling HTTP Requests/Responses:** Sends requests to web servers and displays the received data.  
- **Managing Cookies & Cache:** Stores temporary data to improve browsing speed.  
- **Supporting Multiple Protocols:** Works with HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more.  

### **Popular Web Browsers:**  
- **Google Chrome** – Fast and widely used.  
- **Mozilla Firefox** – Open-source and privacy-focused.  
- **Microsoft Edge** – Integrated with Windows, based on Chromium.  
- **Apple Safari** – Optimized for macOS and iOS.  
- **Opera** – Has built-in VPN and ad blocker.  

## 8. HTML 5.0 (Hypertext Markup Language 5.0)  
HTML 5 is the latest version of HTML, used to structure web pages. Some key features include:  

- **Anatomy of an HTML Document:** Structure includes `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.  
- **Text Basics:** Tags like `<p>` for paragraphs, `<h1>` to `<h6>` for headings, `<b>` for bold, `<i>` for italics, etc.  
- **Rules:** Proper HTML syntax, nesting of elements, and best practices.  
- **Images and Multimedia:** `<img>` for images, `<video>` for videos, `<audio>` for sounds. HTML5 supports embedding media without external plugins.
